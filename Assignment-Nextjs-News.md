# Assignment Next JS - News Portal Theme

## Overview

For the Assignment Next.js, you will work individually to build the front end of an application using Next.js. There will be three different themes for the Assignment Next.js, each with a different set of application flow and requirements. Each project will have general requirements as a minimum, including Admin Panel, Client Side, List of Items, Search, Sorting, and Pagination, User Profile, Landing Page, Data Seeding, etc.

After developing the projects based on the requirements, you have to present your project in front of the trainers and the other trainees. The presentation will have the following guidelines:

- Presentation duration: maximum 15 minutes.
- Before starting the demonstration, show the git status of your project and switch to the latest commit before the deadline.
- App demonstration.
- Brief code explanation.
- Q&A session.

Important things that you have to keep in mind when you do the final project:

- Repository name: `assignment-nextjs-frontend-<yourname>`.
- Add `README.md` with instructions on how to run your app smoothly and include some useful information.
- Make frequent commits with meaningful commit messages.
- Only commits before the defined deadline will be accepted.
- It is better to review your own MR.
- Attach a screenshot of your test coverage to your MR description.
- You can use any component library for your front end.
- The objective of the requirement document is to explain briefly what the minimum requirements are when developing the product. You are still expected to develop your product with good common process practices, as well as good user experience with necessary validation, sorting, pagination, etc., even if it is not described in the document.
- Your application language should be presented in English.
